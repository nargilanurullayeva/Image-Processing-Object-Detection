# Object Detection Using Image Processing
This project focuses on detecting objects in images using image processing techniques. It is particularly designed to detect objects that are difficult to identify using traditional methods.

## Overview
Object detection is a key task in computer vision and has numerous applications, including surveillance, autonomous vehicles, and image retrieval. However, detecting objects in images where they are challenging to identify presents a significant challenge.

This project aims to address this challenge by employing advanced image processing techniques. It utilizes the OpenCV library in Python, which provides a wide range of tools for image analysis and processing.
